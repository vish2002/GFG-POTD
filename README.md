# GFG Problem of the Day Solutions 💻

This repository contains my solutions to the daily Problem of the Day (POTD) from GeeksforGeeks. I'm committed to solving at least one POTD every day and sharing my solutions here. 🚀

## Why am I doing this? 🤔

Regularly practicing coding problems is crucial for improving my problem-solving skills and staying sharp. By solving the GFG POTD on a daily basis, I aim to:

1. Enhance my understanding of data structures and algorithms. 🧠
2. Develop better logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. 🤯
3. Prepare myself for technical interviews and coding challenges. 🎯
4. Contribute to the programming community by sharing my solutions and insights. 🤝

## Repository Structure 🗂️

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Solutions**: This directory contains the solution files for each GFG POTD problem. Each solution is stored in a separate file named after the problem, e.g., `find-the-number.py`, `rotate-linked-list.cpp`.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the repository and instructions for using it.

## How to Use This Repository 🤖

1. **Browse the Solutions**: You can explore the solutions to various GFG POTD problems in the `Solutions` directory. Each solution file contains the problem statement, my approach, and the code implementation. 🔍

2. **Learn from the Solutions**: Feel free to study the solutions and understand the underlying algorithms and techniques used. You can use these solutions as a reference to improve your own problem-solving skills. 💡

3. **Contribute**: If you have a better or more efficient solution to a problem, I encourage you to submit a pull request. I'm always open to learning from the community and improving the existing solutions. 🤝
